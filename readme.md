Digital Strategy Drupal Module
===========================================

Creates 3 page nodes for digital strategy progess on enable. Also creates menu callbacks which load the page nodes and output just the body with the appropriate content type headers.

Goals
----------

In order to generate a Gov't wide report to show all agencies progress toward meeting the Gov't Digital Strategy each agency is required to provide easy access to their report in 3 machine-readble formats (xml, json, and jsonp).

Requirements
------------

* Drupal 6.x
* Path module enabled

Usage
-----

Place the module in the /sites/all/modules directory of your Drupal installation and enable it in the admin UI.

How it Works
------------

When the module is enabled (.install file) 3 page nodes are created: digital-strategy/progress-xml, digital-strategy/progress-json, digital-strategy/progress-jsonp. Menu callback items are created, digital-strategy/xml, digital-strategy/json, and digital-strategy/jsonp in the .module file.

These urls provide the progress reports without the theme and with the correct content type headers.
